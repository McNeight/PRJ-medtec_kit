In this document we will inventory the ADC that we can use in our prototype.

## Specifications

We want at least 6 points of measurement per cycle when digitalising the data. The highest frequency we use is 7.5 MHz so we want at least **45 Msps**.

If we refer to the ADC used classically in the ultrasonic probe, the precision of the ADC must **10 or 12 bits**.

We use AD8331 or AD8332 as TGC in our device, nowing that these devices have a differential output, so the ADC must have **diffrential input**. Moreover, these TGC are optimise for 10/12 bits precision adc.
